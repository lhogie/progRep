\title{Distributed programming}
\begin{document}

This project will cover 24h of study of distributed programming. It covers the root concepts, technologies and practices encountered in this field.

The target of this project is to build a peer-2-peer system, which the is a distributed software that work with no central authority. Insteads it operates thanks to the cooperation of its interacting components, called its peers.
Such decentralized system have the advantages of being resilient to failures.
All nodes in a p2p network are equal. There is no such role as client of server. Each node act as both client an server.

\section{Writing a basic UDP broadcast communicating strings}

Write a Node class which implements a node with communicate with other node using UDP. When a node receives a message (string), it relays it to its peers. A node do not relay twice the same message.

\section{Reading/saving peer list from/to file}
The code for reading and writing the file is provided.

\section{Transferring not only string objects}

\section{Writing a Swing-based GUI}

\section{Limits the range of a message}
In number of hops.

Similarly, limit the lifetime of a message.

\subsection{Periodic read of the file}
